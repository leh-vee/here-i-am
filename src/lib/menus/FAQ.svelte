<h4>Where are you?</h4>
<p>Here I am.</p>
<h4>Why were you hiding?</h4>
<p>It happened so fast, he counted down from three stepped off the edge and fell.</p>
<h4>Lord, what have you done?</h4>
<p>Listen! His fall cries out to us from the soil. </p>
<h4>But what were you doing on the roof? </h4>
<p>I needed some air, an overview if you like. I envied your perspective.</p>
<h4>You did try and stop him?</h4>
<p>I thought he was playing, I thought the countdown was a game.</p>
<h4>Someone standing at the edge of a tower, counting down from three is a game to you?</h4>
<p>It was only a dream, remember.</p>
<h4>Who is he, this man whose death you dreamt of?</h4>
<p>I'm not sure, but that was the game.</p>
<h4>You were trying to remember him in the dream?</h4>
<p>I was trying to guess who he was before he arrived at zero. He was supposed to turn around and face me at zero, like an old friend. But he stepped off the edge instead. Like I said, it wasn't my fault.  </p>
<h4>But you did remember him eventually, isn't that right?</h4>
<p>Yes, lying there afterward with my eyes closed, half asleep still.  </p>
<h4>Say his name.</h4>
<p>But I can't remember his name.</p>
<h4>Of course you can, you remember what you want to remember.</h4>
<p>He was a character from the neighborhood. I saw his aviator shades and baby face around all the time before the pandemic. I’d forgotten about him altogether until I climbed up on the roof.</p>
<h4>A character, I thought he was your friend?</h4>
<p>Once upon a time we may have been Facebook friends, but I can’t picture us ever getting that close, no. For one thing we're too similar. Otherwise, he's so strange. Recall his Chinese military issue barrets and pork pie hats reminiscent of a jazz musician from another century. A silver, wallet chain dangled from his pocket but he was an old man, a retired bodyguard. He had a red notebook of detailed architectural drawings and miniscule hand writing that he tossed around like it meant nothing to him.</p>
<h4>Who walks around with a red notebook?</h4>
<p>We did, but his was scuffed, pocket-size and double-duty dense with pages. Some were falling out, some were dog-eared. There was an elastic holding it all together; a perfectly compact symbol of harmless eccentricity, in red. His shirt pocket was always full of pens, even at night, over drinks. A show of force. But there was an elegance to him too, the pretense of sophistication. He pulled out the notebook when a pretty young thing asked him if he'd really partied with Axel Rose, and tossed it out on the bar like the proof was scribbled down on one of the innumerable pages. I turned to look, sitting on his other hand, opposite her, and she said you want in on this like she was preparing to humiliate him to death and offering herself to me all at once, like she was speaking to me privately even though her voice had to carry past his to reach me. Like she was talking through him.</p>
<h4>And you did want in, didn't you?</h4>
<p>I don't know, I'm not sure. Maybe. Likely, yes. I thought she was flirting with me and I didn't want her to stop. I asked him some questions, to keep the ball rolling. But they were shy of cruel, the questions. Open ended. I gave him enough rope if you like, but I was also genuinely curious I think. About the notebook, and about him.</p>
<h4>What else do you remember from that night?</h4>
<p>He'd worked security at a big stadium in town through the 90's. He said he was a writer too. But when I asked him if he'd published anything he murmured no, I'm a nobody his hands up in self defence.</p>
<h4>Look who thinks he's nobody.</h4>
<p>Lol.</p>
<h4>Did you and the woman humiliate him to death and go fuck or what?</h4>
<p>I'd like to believe I resigned myself to being his wingman; I cut him off mercifully having come to understand that to let him go on was to allow a man to flagellate himself. Enough about us I said, let's get to know our new friend, and made a pushing gesture with my hands toward the woman, like encouraging him to ask her about herself. But she didn't like that at all and goes we've known each other for a long time buddy, we're neighbours drawing out the word like I’d never know what it really means, and leans in toward him, closing their bodies off to mine, excluding me from the rest of their conversation.   </p>
<h4>So you didn't get his name?</h4>
<p>I did because later that night he turns to me out of the blue to say people in this country don't know what freedom is, I've known freedom. His neighbour was gone, to the bathroom I guessed. But when I asked him what real freedom looked like he shunned me once more. I don't like the tone of your questions he says. Which was the end of the line for me. I got up to go home, but before leaving I offered him my hand and said see you around man, because I saw him around all the time as you know, and I'd continue to and I gave him my name and he told me his.  </p>
<h4>Say his name.</h4>
<p>I don't remember it, honestly. It occurred to me that I’d already forgotten it like five minutes after hearing it, as the elevator went clicking along and I was fishing inside my bag for my apartment key.  </p>
<h4>Say his name.</h4>
<p>I yelled it as he jumped, I yelled out to him, but when I awoke his name was already faded from the tip of my tongue. But I could make out his face briefly; I pictured all your faces vaguely as my twilight sleep lifted in the early blue. </p>
<h4>Where were we?</h4>
<p>At ground level, staring up at me. I'd barely brought myself to look down over the edge, and there you were. Pork pie hat was standing among you, alive and well. It was truly a relief, but terrifying all the same.</p>
<h4>Were there many of us?</h4>
<p>Perhaps a dozen. </p>
<h4>What were we doing down there?</h4>
<p>You'd formed a circle around where his corpse should have been. You were expectant, in anticipation. You’d arrived at a conclusion.</p>
<h4>Who were we then?</h4>
<p>I'm not sure what to call you. Is there a German word for a stranger whose face one sees very frequently, but inexplicably so? Like never in the same place, or at same time of day. A stranger that isn't quite a rando.</p>
<h4>A juror?</h4>
<p>Ha! You really are a pleasure to spend time with now and then.</p>
<h4>But in the dream we freighted you?</h4>
<p>I didn’t want to jump, even if it was my turn. I didn’t want to get it over with. And the poem, it was almost within your reach. </p>
<h4>Tell us about the poem once more.</h4>
<p>It was anonymously taped up around our neighborhood, at a few intersections. You must have seen it. The text was very small and scrunched into a column down the centre of the page. There was a copy outside my building and as soon as it was taken down someone would put up a fresh one, but I never witnessed either act. I’d imagine staking out the scene, staying up all night like a detective to uncover who was doing what, but the very whimsy of the thought betrayed my exhaustion.</p>
<h4>But what was it doing in the dream?</h4>
<p>I don’t know. It was falling, but not the way a body falls off the side of a building. It was kind of tumbling in the wind between us. </p>
<h4>You wanted to get to us before it did?</h4>
<p>Yes, but I took the elevator.</p>
<h4>Which is where the dream ended?</h4>
<p>I was waiting for the ground floor anxiously and impatiently and just as I suspected it was him, that the poem had fallen out of his pocket as he was falling, the dream faded.</p>
<h4>You suspected he was the poet, posting it around?</h4>
<p>Yes, it all just kind of made sense to me that morning. </p>
<h4>What made sense?</h4>
<p>The small font size. The anonymity. The strained eloquence: the hallmark of an otherwise cagey writer. The epic graffiti of it all. I’ll bet some of the verses are scrawled in dive bar bathrooms. And it’s exactly the amount of flirting with taboo an otherwise polite Asian Canadian would allow himself to get away with on the page. </p>
<h4>Who's Asian here?</h4>
<p>He is, you are, the poet who disappeared off the side of my building.</p>
<h4>What kind of Asian are we talking about?</h4>
<p>I'm not sure. Filipino I think or maybe Chinese. </p>
<h4>You've lived in one of the most diverse cities in the world for decades and you can't differentiate between a Filipino and a Chinese face?</h4>
<p>I'm scared of where my mind will go if I look too closely at strangers. </p>
<h4>What are you so afraid of?</h4>
<p>Dying. Public speaking. Not necessarily in that order.</p>
<h4>Are you sure you’re not racist?</h4>
<p>I’m as racist as an AI if I had to guess. </p>
<h4>Are you sure you didn't write the poem?</h4>
<p>I'd give it a long look sometimes on my way out the door for a covid constitutional, but no, I don't believe I wrote it.</p>
<h4>But you adapted it for the virtual concrete of the small screen, why?</h4>
<p>Yes, for him, for you. I was trying to say I see you, or I'm sorry that I can't see you but I’m trying, I tried. </p>
<h4>Aren’t you trying to protect the poem from us, from him, to explain it to us; isn’t that what the dream is about, your arrogance?</h4>
<p>But it was only after I came to believe that pork pie hat had in fact died, that things got a bit crazy. I really thought I had found a way to talk to him, to hear you. I don't know. </p>
<h4>You went crazy during the pandemic?</h4>
<p>I saw her, the good neighbor from the bar, the one with all the memorable lines, coming out of a funeral parlour and I jumped to conclusions I guess. You know how intuition works, sort of badly but forcefully. This was like a month after I'd had the dream.</p>
<h4>She told you that pork pie hat was gone?</h4>
<p>No, we didn't really acknowledge each other. She passed me on the sidewalk and I looked at her kind of openly, but hidden within myself that way we do, like giving her the option in case she remembered me or wanted to, but she didn't or whatever… She looked broken up, like she'd been crying in there. It seemed like a bad idea to say hello. </p>
<h4>And just like that you were convinced he was dead?</h4>
<p>No, but like all the copies of the poem had disappeared by then and weren’t being reposted and I just wandered around aimlessly looking for a trace without feeling much of anything. But when I approached the building, gazed up toward my roof and sky the ground lurched out from under me. I still cast my eyes low when I’m nearly home, but sometimes curiosity gets the better of me and I look for it, the vertigo, to see if it's still there. It felt good too, it felt honest. </p>
<h4>But that wasn’t the crazy part was it?</h4>
<p>No. I wasn't myself that night, I couldn't focus. I got lost in my phone sitting on my meditation bench,  having given up on a breathwork app I'd decided to try when I remembered I'd taken a photo of the poem. But I didn't want to read it. I never really liked it in the first place. I kind of hate poetry actually, or just find it too confusing to want to bother with, like a dream. But when I opened it the magnification was super high and I sort of scrolled around it like it was a map which was and surprisingly interesting. I followed the stupid numbers all the way down and the familiarity of the disorder dawned on me, creeped me right out and then I don't know, what happened next?</p>
<h4>I called out your name.</h4>
<p>Yes, there was the countdown, and the irrational numbers following just like in the elevator before I woke up, I remembered. And then I closed my eyes and just let myself fall, just let myself feel my truth which is that I'm about to die for no reason other than everyone dies for no reason, like when they’re not expecting it.</p>
<h4>And we caught you?</h4>
<p>Yes, the fall continued but it was like you were lowering me into the ground. I was still falling but I wasn't waiting for the impact, just the comfort of settling into forever. And we were falling together, very slowly, our heartbreaks intermingling like the city streets with the winds'.</p>
<h4>We were helping each other die?</h4>
<p>But I don't want to call it love unless what you mean by loving your neighbor as your self is softening the grip on one’s self composure. Perhaps there never even was a centre to hold on to if you will, like it or not.</p>
<h4>Enough, let's get down to business.</h4>
<p>Yes dear, let's bring this tango to a close.</p>
<p>Will you stab me right in the throat like I'm a monster?</p>
<h4>Yes. But don't be afraid, it's nothing but poetry all the way down.</h4>
<p>Ready?</p>
<h4>3,2,1</h4>
<p>…</p>
