is a poem about an intersection
destined at a crossroads
is a map for arriving where
you happen to be standing
is a countdown that never ends
until seemingly it does
is marginalia graffitied 
between the lines of a city
is a bridge from the self
to the Self that is other
is a database of anxiety
approaching narrativity
is a meditation on not being
able to slow yourself down
is a gesture towards infinity
from the comfort of your phone
is as simple as pie,
though not a piece of cake
is something you can play
but not anything you can beat
