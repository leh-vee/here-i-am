is a map about arriving
right where you're standing
is a countdown that never ends
until seemingly it does
is a poem for an intersection
waiting at a crossroads
is marginalia scribbled
between the lines of a city
is a wish for a better bridge
to the self from the other
is a catalogue of differences
we all have in common
is a database of anxiety
approaching narrativity
is a meditation on not being
able to slow yourself down
is a gesture towards infinity
from the comfort of your phone
is as simple as pie,
though not a piece of cake
is something you can play
but not a thing you can beat
