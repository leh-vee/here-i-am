is a poem about an intersection, in a cityful
of intersections, destined at a crossroads.
is a map concerend with the difficulty of arriving
where you happen to already be standing.
is a countdown that never seems to end until
suddenly, and predictably, it seemingly does.
is a pocket-size graffiti mural: marginalia 
scribbled between Toronto's centrelines.
