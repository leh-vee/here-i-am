is a map of the problem
about arriving where you are
is a countdown that never ends
until predictably, it does
is a poem on running away
from the crossroads of poetry
is marginalia scribbled
between city lines
is a wish for a better bridge
to the self from the other
is a database of anxiety
approaching narrativity
is a meditation on not being
able to slow the beast down
is a gesture toward infinity
from the comfort of your phone
is as simple as pie,
though not a piece of cake
is something you can play
but not a thing you can beat
