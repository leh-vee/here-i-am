is a poem about an intersection
destined at a crossroads
is a map for arriving where
you happen to be standing
is a countdown that never ends
until seemingly it does
is marginalia graffitied 
between the lines of a city
is an index of anxiety
approaching a narrative
is as simple as pie,
but not a piece of cake
is something you can play
though you can't win
