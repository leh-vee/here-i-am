In the late summer of 2021 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the first lockdown shuttered the place indefinitely. 
I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, a woman who came and went strictly alone but had a smile for everyone. That she was eavesdropping on all of us was an open secret. She saw it all, and we liked showing it to her. 
Reading the poem became a ritual of my daily, pandemic stroll for a few months until each of the copies, or at least the ten I'd found disappeared. They were all gone by the fall.
Its pile up of character sketches made me nostalgic for those ecstatic, busy nights when I'd get high from feeling like I was putting on an incredible performance of my job for the crowded bar. Likenesses groped around me slowly, right out of people's bones as I gracefully raced through their drink orders. I checked in on her more often than I needed to, just to see whether I was okay.
I lost track of so many locals during covid; dozens of faces I might not be able to put a name to any longer. I tried memorizing the verses, and would recall them as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering which one was about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were.
