In the summer of 2020 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the lockdown shuttered it. I had a hunch about who the author was; a regular who’d come and go strictly alone, but seemed to always have the time for whoever was chatting her up, including yours truly. We told her everything. The verses traced dozens of local characters who I’d lost track of during the pandemic. I liked recalling them as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering which one was about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were. Looking out for and reading the poem became a ritual part of my daily stroll, until all the copies had finally disappeared, well into the fall. I was more or less used to my new, solitary life by then; days and nights spent with a computer, learning to write code.
