Here I Am is a concrete poetry video game, adapted from a poem which was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood while it was under lockdown, in the summer of 2020. Copies were taped up at ten intersections; one appeared outside the shuttered hole in the wall where I'd bartended for about a decade. I was already used to spending a lot of time alone with my computer by then, learning to code. I’d get out for a walk every day, and for a few months part of the ritual was to stop and give the poem a look, or notice the copies disappear, one after another until they were all gone, well into the fall. I had a hunch it was written by a regular; she came and left the bar strictly on her own, but had the time to give to any imperfect stranger crowding the place it seemed, including yours truly. The verses traced dozens of local characters who I’d lost track of during the pandemic. I liked recalling them as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering which one was about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were. What is love but the mystery slowing us down on our way back home?
