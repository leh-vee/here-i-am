In the late summer of 2021 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the first lockdown shuttered the place indefinitely. 
I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, a woman who kept to herself but had a sad smile for everyone. That she was eavesdropping on all of us was an open secret.
Reading the poem became a ritual of my daily, pandemic stroll for a few months until each of the copies, or at least the ten I'd found disappeared. They were all gone by the fall. I tried memorizing it, recalling the verses as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering if any of them were about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were.
I lost track of dozens of locals during the covid years; I see their likenesses all over town now, so many names on the tip of my tongue.
