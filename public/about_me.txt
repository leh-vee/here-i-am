In the summer of 2020 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the lockdown shuttered the place indefinitely. I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, a woman who always came and left alone, but seemed to have all the time in the world for whoever she ended up sitting next to, including yours truly. We told her everything. The verses traced dozens of local characters who I’d lost track of during the pandemic. I liked recalling them as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering which one was about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were. Looking out for copies of the poem became a ritual part of my daily stroll until there were none left standing, well into the fall. I was more or less used to my new, solitary life by then; days and nights spent in front of a computer, learning to code.
