Here I Am is a concrete poetry video game adapted from a poem flyered around my neighborhood while under lockdown, in the summer of 2020. Copies were anonymously taped up at ten intersections; one appeared on the corner where the hole in the wall that I'd been a bartender at for the past decade stood. Somehow I was already used to spending a lot of time alone with my computer by then, learning to code. I went out for a stroll every day, and for a few months part of the ritual was to stop and give it a look, until none were left standing. I had a hunch that it was written by a regular. I saw traces of various locals reflected in the verses, and other familiar faces whose names I couldn't recall. I felt hopeful thinking of them as I strayed up and down the sidestreets and alleyways, wondering if any one was about me.
