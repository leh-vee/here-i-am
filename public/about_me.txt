In the summer of 2020 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the lockdown shuttered the place indefinitely. I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, a woman who always came and left alone, but seemed to have all the time in the world for anyone ready to talk, including yours truly. We told her everything.
Reading the poem became a ritual of my daily stroll for a few months until all the copies, at least the ten I'd found, inevitably disappeared for one reason or another, well into the fall. Its pile up of character sketches reminded me of how much I liked the feeling of being lost in the crowded impressions up at the bar on busy nights, and left me reminiscing about all the locals I’d lost track of during the pandemic. I tried memorizing it, and would recall the verses word by word as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering which one was about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were.
