Here I Am is a concrete poetry video game, adapted from a poem which was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood while it was under lockdown, in the summer of 2020. There were copies taped up at ten intersections. One appeared on a corner where the hole in the wall that I'd been a bartender at for the past decade stood. I was already used to spending a lot of time alone with my computer by then, learning to code. I went out for a stroll every day, and for a few months part of the ritual was to stop and give the poem a look, until none remained. I had a hunch it was written by a regular; she came and went strictly on her own, but had the time for everyone. The verses traced dozens of local characters who I’d lost track of during the pandemic. I liked recalling them as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering if any one was about me.
