In the late summer of 2021 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the first lockdown shuttered the place for good. 
I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, an attentive woman who kept to herself. That she was eavesdropping on all of us, there from her corner stool was an open secret. I’d check on her often; more often than she cared for.
Reading the poem became a ritual of my daily, pandemic stroll until all the copies, or at least the ten I'd found slowly disappeared. They were all gone by the fall. I tried memorizing it, recalling the verses as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering if any of them were about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were.
I lost track of at least a dozen locals during the covid years. I see their likenesses all over town now that the city has reopened, but never her, not even once. Which is for the best because I can’t imagine what I’d say.
