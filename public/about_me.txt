In the late summer of 2021 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the first lockdown shuttered the place indefinitely. 
I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, a quiet woman who came and went strictly alone but had a smile for everyone. That she was eavesdropping on all of us was an open secret. She saw it all happened, and we liked showing it to her. 
Reading the poem became a ritual of my daily, pandemic stroll for a few months until each of the copies, or at least the ten I'd found disappeared. They were all gone by the fall. I tried memorizing it, recalling the verses as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering if any of them were about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were.
Its pile up of character sketches made me nostalgic for those ecstatic, busy nights when I'd get high from feeling like I was putting on an incredible performance of my job for the crowded bar. The likenesses groped at me, right out of my bones, as I gracefully raced through their drink orders. I checked in on her way more often than she cared for on such nights, whenever I needed a break.
I lost track of so many locals during the covid years that most days, ever since the world reopened I think I recognize a face that I can't put a name to, if I ever could.
