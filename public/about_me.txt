In the summer of 2020 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the lockdown shuttered the place indefinitely. I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, a woman who always came and left alone, but seemed to have all the time in the world for anyone ready to talk, including yours truly. We told her everything.
Reading the poem became a ritual of my daily stroll for a few months until each of the copies, or at least the ten I'd found disappeared. They were all gone by the winter. A couple seemed to have been torn down, in anger perhaps. It was easy to imagine the poem upsetting someone, and just as easy to imagine the very idea as absurd. When was the last time a poem offended anyone?
Its pile up of character sketches reminded me of how much I liked the feeling of being lost in the crowd of impressions up at the bar on busy nights, and left me wondering after all the locals I’d lost track of during the pandemic. I tried memorizing the poem and would recall the verses word by word as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering which one was about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were.
