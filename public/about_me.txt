In the summer of 2020 a poem titled Here I Am was anonymously flyered around my neighborhood. I first read it while out for a walk, outside a hole in the wall where I’d bartended for the past decade, before the lockdown shuttered the place indefinitely. I had a hunch that the author was a longtime regular, a woman who always came and went alone, but had a big smile for everyone. That she was eavesdropping on all of us was an open secret. She saw it all, and we liked showing it to her.
Reading the poem became a ritual of my daily, pandemic stroll for a few months until each of the copies, or at least the ten I'd found disappeared. They were all gone by the fall.
Its pile up of character sketches reminded me of how it felt to be lost in the crowded impressions up at the bar on busy nights. I lost track of so many locals during the pandemic; dozens of faces I might not be able to put a name to any longer. I tried memorizing the verses, and would recall them as I strayed up and down the side streets and alleyways, wondering which one was about me, unaccountably hopeful that all of them were.
