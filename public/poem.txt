the wet, market smile of her forgotten face, still
spreading our neighbourly chill around the ward
all together chinked by the overhearing
of a featherweight junction's heavy breathing
today's creamiest wight, a newly lost Israelite
never quite there in their universalism
the superstitious cleaving to silence's rift
stuttered into being before the first, broken word
too openly expectant and bright yellow
for a blossom jumping out between concrete slabs
never honestly small enough
to sink into the nothing special
fluttering through the sky's empty promise
face first – into its shards of brilliance
a headless extrusion on the verge of wailing
peaceably, on behalf of an unlimited injury
the man waving to my woman as she rides me
like a mare down May's flowery avenues
holding on to more appeal 
than anyone could deal with
too good to let a man's fragile shelter inside
these years of contempt that press on, homeless
trapped in the overflow of a mirror room
with the lonely echo of her empty womb
a youthful rebellion playing
right into the blazing pyre
of the stupid billions, one smouldering expression
finally saying what they'd really been thinking
an orange hope of leaves helicoptering down to your rescue
across the thinning innocence of our boundless blues
this narrow, circular talk most of all outlasting
the vicious reality of everyone and everything else
yesterday's balloon long gone fishing for dad,
the white knight on a quest to name his cover band
original as any gangster lashing out at mother:
bitch never really liked me, she only ever loved me
an ancient bend along this Indian road
following the cheerful path of least resistance
yesterday's gibberish sparing you
the old news from the front lines
feeding the alien splendour
of it can only get better
a monkish passion for the unknown always
about to touch itself, right here on your front lawn
working hard on this now, eternally speaking
of an obscure humility bridging shame and pride
turning away from the loner concealing
an envious bearing aimed at people watching
interrupting the dead beast's dream
of once and for all scrubbing off clean
the faith of baby’s outstretched arm
waiting on whatever's taking so long
stomaching the air above
a childishly direct question
the shadowy chasm coming up
closer, the closer we find each other
another repetition of what was me,
the impossible boundary between us
violently kicking and screaming over what
the long, drawn out lullaby was on about
consumed by her marquee, home address
accurate down to the obscuring order of a clue
his bitter endurance sentenced to life
in a nutshell, stripping infinity to its core value
a tower of nobodies overcome by the flooding
nauseous flush of misfortune's bottomless rush
whistling that inscrutable number
murmuring for you know who
asking every stranger I can:
am I what I am
