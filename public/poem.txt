the wet, market smile of her forgotten face, still
spreading our neighbourly chill around the ward
all together chinked by the overhearing
of a featherweight junction's heavy breathing
today's creamiest wights, a new lost tribe of Israel
never quite there in their universalism
the superstitious cleaving to silence's rift
stuttered into being before the first, broken word
too openly expectant and bright yellow
for a blossom jumping out between concrete slabs
never honestly small enough to – like dust 
the ashen toss and turn – sink into the nothing special
fluttering through the sky's glassy promise
face first into its shards of brilliance
a headless extrusion on the verge of wailing
peaceably on behalf of an unlimited injury
the man waving to my woman as she rides me
like a mare, down May's flowery avenues
every darling's kind of prayer to be
essential; a perfect toy for the world
too good to let a man's fragile shelter inside
these years of contempt that press on, homeless
inescapable as the echo of a mirror room,
the growing silence within her womb
a youthful enthusiasm feeding 
into the blazing pyre
the smouldering emanation of eight billion
crying out desperately, as one from solitary
an orange hope of leaves helicoptering down to your rescue
across the thinning innocence of our boundless blues
this narrow, circular talk most of all outlasting
the vicious reality of everyone and everything
yesterday's balloon long gone fishing for dad,
the white knight on a quest to name his cover band
original as any gangster lashing out at mother:
bitch never really liked me, she only ever loved me
an ancient bend along this Indian road
following the cheerful path of least resistance
great grandfather's gibberish cyrillic script
sparring you the old news from the front lines
the microaggressive splendour of an ideal future
discounting our predictably alienated humankind
a monkish passion for the unknown always
about to touch itself, right here on your front lawn
working hard on this now, eternally speaking
of a liminal humility bridging shame and pride
turning away from the loner concealing
an envious bearing aimed at people watching
barely interrupting the dead beast
dream, of once and for all going clean
the tender faith of your baby brother's arm
waiting its turn to grab whatever is taking so long
stomaching the lofty air to avoid an ancient deep,
dark descent into the unifying ferocity of wonder
his sad song veiling an unfathomable chasm
getting closer, the closer she gets to getting close
another repetition of what could ultimately be
my name, an unpronounceable boundary between us
the violence kicking and screaming about what
was from the very beginning a long, drawn out lullabye
consumed by her marquee, home address
accurate down to the obscuring order of a clue
his simple, bitter endurance sentenced to life
in a nutshell stripping infinity to its core values
a tower of nobodies overcome by the flooding
nauseous flush of misfortune's bottomless rush
impersonating the inscrutable passivity
of a murmuring number never arriving for who
asking the only stranger I can:
am I what I am
