the wet, market smile of her forgotten face, still
spreading our neighbourly chill around the ward
all together chinked by the overhearing
of a featherweight junction's heavy breathing
today's creamiest wight, a newly lost Israelite
not quite there in their universalism
the superstitious cleaving to silence's rift
stuttered into being before the first, broken word
too openly expectant and bright yellow
for a blossom jumping out between concrete slabs
never honestly small enough to – like dust 
the ashen toss and turn – sink into the nothing special
fluttering through the sky's empty promise
face first into its shards of brilliance
a headless extrusion on the verge of wailing
peaceably on behalf of an unlimited injury
the man waving to my woman as she rides me
like a mare, down May's flowery avenues
his sort of darling, going essentially
unseen; a perfect toy for the world
too good to let a man's fragile shelter inside
these years of contempt that press on, homeless
inescapable as the echo in a mirror room,
the overflowing silence of her womb
a youthful rebellion playing
right into the blazing pyre
of the naive billions, one smouldering expression
undercutting what was appealing about our company
an orange hope of leaves helicoptering down to your rescue
across the thinning innocence of our boundless blues
this narrow, circular talk most of all outlasting
the vicious reality of everyone and everything else
yesterday's balloon long gone fishing for dad,
the white knight on a quest to name his cover band
original as any gangster lashing out at mother:
bitch never really liked me, she only ever loved me
an ancient bend along this Indian road
following the cheerful path of least resistance
great grandfather's gibberish cyrillic script sparring you
the old news from the front lines
the microaggressive splendour of an ideal future
discounting our predictably alienated humankind
a monkish passion for the unknown always
about to touch itself, right here on your front lawn
working hard on this now, eternally speaking
of a liminal humility bridging shame and pride
turning away from the loner concealing
an envious bearing aimed at people watching
interrupting the dead beast's dream
of once and for all scrubbing off clean
the tender faith of your baby sister's arm
waiting its turn to grab whatever is taking so long
stomaching the lofty air high above
the shallow of wonder's simple shadow
her foggy notion veiling the chasm up
closer, the closer we get to getting each other
another repetition of what could be
my name, the impossible boundary between us
the violence kicking and screaming about what
was from the beginning a long, drawn out lullabye
consumed by her marquee, home address
accurate down to the obscuring order of a clue
his simple, bitter endurance sentenced to life
in a nutshell stripping infinity to its core value
a tower of nobodies overcome by the flooding
nauseous flush of misfortune's bottomless rush
impersonating that inscrutable murmuring lost
inside all those numbers whistling, for who
asking every stranger I can:
am I what I am
