Where are you?
Here I am…
Why were you hiding?
it happened so fast, he counted down from three stepped off the edge and fell.
Lord, what have you done?
Listen! His fall cries out to us from the soil.
But what were you doing on the roof? 
I needed some air, an overview if you like. I envied your perspective.
You don’t understand; did you try to stop him!?
I thought he was playing, I thought the countdown was a game.
Someone standing at the edge of a tower, counting down from three is a game to you?
It was only a dream, remember?
Who was he, this man you dreamt of?
I'm not sure, but that was the game
You were trying to remember him in the dream?
I was trying to guess who he was before he arrived at zero. He was supposed to turn around and face me at zero, like an old friend. But he stepped off the edge instead.
Still, you did remember him eventually, isn't that right?
Yes, lying there afterward with my eyes closed, half asleep still.  
Say his name.
But I can't remember his name
Of course you can, you remember what you want to remember.
He was a character from the neighborhood. I saw his aviator shades and baby face around all the time before the pandemic. I’d forgotten about him altogether until I climbed up on the roof.
A character, I thought he was your friend
Once upon a time we may have been Facebook friends, but there’s an impossible boundary between us. For one thing we're too similar. And he’s so strange otherwise. Recall his Chinese-military-issue barrets and pork pie hats reminiscent of a jazz musician from another century. A silver chain would dangle from his pocket like a kid or an aristocrat. But he was an old man, a retired bodyguard. He had a gold notebook full of convoluted geometric figures and miniscule hand writing that he tossed around like it meant nothing to him.
Who walks around with a gold notebook?
Honestly, I do. But his was a scuffed, pocket-size number densely packed with a brick’s worth of pages. Some were falling out, some were dog-eared. There was an elastic holding it all together; a perfectly compact symbol of the harmless weight of eccentricity, in gold. One night he pulled the notebook out when a pretty young thing asked him if he'd really partied with Van Halen; tossed it on the bar like it was proof. I was seated on his other hand, opposite her, and when I turned to look she said you want in on this with a smile like she was preparing to humiliate him to death and offering herself to me all at once, like she was speaking to me privately.
And you did want in, didn't you?
Maybe. Likely, yes. I thought she was flirting with me and I didn't want her to stop. I asked him some questions, to keep the ball rolling, but they were shy of cruel, the questions. Open-ended. I gave him enough rope if you like, but I was also genuinely curious, I think, about the notebook and him.
So, what did you learn then?
He'd worked security at a big stadium in town through the 90's. He’d been married. He was divorced. Three kids, joint custody. He liked making them supper, the only believable part of the story really. He said he was a writer too, and an architect. But when I asked him if he'd published anything he murmured no, I'm a nobody his hands up in self defence.
Look who thinks he's nobody lol
I guess
Did you and the woman humiliate him to death and go fuck or what?
I'd like to believe I resigned myself to being his wingman. At some point I cut him off having come to understand that to let him go on was to allow a man to flagellate himself. Enough about us I said, let's get to know our new friend, and made a pushing gesture with my hands toward the woman, like encouraging him to ask her about herself. But she didn't like that at all and goes we've known each other for a long time buddy, we're neighbours drawing out the word like I’d never know what it really means, and leans in toward him, closing their bodies off to mine, excluding me from the rest of their conversation.   
So you didn't get his name?
I did because later that night he turns to me out of the blue to say people in this country don't know what freedom is, I've known freedom. She was gone by then, but when I asked him what real freedom looked like he shunned me again. I don't like the tone of your questions he says. Which was the end of the line for me. I got up to go home, but before leaving I offered him my hand and said see you around man, because I saw him around all the time as you know, and I'd continue to and I gave him my name and he told me his.
Say his name.
I don't remember it, honestly. It occurred to me that I’d already forgotten it like five minutes after hearing it, as the elevator went ticking along and I was fishing around for my apartment key.  
Say his name.
I yelled it as he jumped, I yelled out to him, but when I awoke his name was already faded from the tip of my tongue. But I could make out his face in my mind’s eye briefly; I pictured all your faces, vaguely as my twilight sleep lifted in the early blue. 
Where were we?
At ground level, staring up at me. I'd barely brought myself to look down over the edge, and there you were. Pork pie hat was standing among you, alive and well. It was truly a relief, but terrifying all the same.
Were there many of us?
Perhaps a dozen 
What were we doing down there?
You'd formed a circle around where his mangled corpse should have been, your many eyes trained on me.
Who else was down there, among us?
I'm not sure what to call you. Is there a German word for a stranger whose face one sees very frequently, but inexplicably so? Like never in the same place, or at same time of day. A stranger who isn't quite a rando.
A juror?
OMG yes! That's too funny
Funny how?
I’m not sure… the way the poem is funny I guess.
Which one?
The one that was anonymously taped up around our neighborhood, at a handful of intersections during the pandemic. You must have seen it. The text was very small and scrunched into a column down the centre of the page. You practically had to press your nose up against the flyer to make out what it said beyond the title. There was a copy right outside my building and for a while, when it was torn down a fresh one was posted within a day or two.
But what was it doing in the dream?
It was falling, but not the way a body falls off the side of a building. It was kind of sailing, billowing in the wind.
Where did it land eventually?
I was back in the elevator before it happened, unable to find the button for the ground floor, desperately searching.
And that’s where the dream ended?
It kept stopping, the elevator, to let on unfamiliar faces. And just as I suspected it was him – that the poem had fallen out of his pocket as he fell – the dream spat me back up.
You suspected he was the poet, posting it around?
Yes, it all just kind of made sense to me that morning
What made sense?
The small font size. The anonymity. The epic graffiti of it all. A bathroom stall poet emboldened by the lockdown – I saw it clearly. And it’s exactly the amount of flirting with taboo an otherwise polite Asian Canadian would allow himself to get away with on the page. 
Who's Asian here?
He is, you are, the poet who stepped over the edge.
What kind of Asian are we talking about?
I'm not sure. Filipino I think or maybe Chinese
You've lived in one of the most diverse cities in the world for decades and you can't differentiate between a Filipino and a Chinese face?
I'm scared of where my mind will go if I look too closely at strangers.
What are you so afraid of?
Dying. Public speaking. Not necessarily in that order
It was strange how often you stopped to read it.
I was lingering over it more than I was reading it to be fair. On my way out the door I’d have a look, procrastinating my covid constitutional, that’s all.
Did it speak to you?
I suppose it must have.
I don’t get it, what’s it about?
The invisible people we can’t seem to ever rid ourselves of fast enough.
And yet you’ve memorialized them in the virtual concrete of the dark screen.
I felt called to make a sacrifice, a video game you might not like.
By who, who called you?
I don’t know, by him, by me…
So basically you lost your mind?
It was the pandemic, you had to. Everyone was doing it.
Yes, but there’s no one else here
I saw her, the good neighbor from the bar, the one with all the memorable lines, coming out of a funeral parlour and I jumped to conclusions I guess. You know how intuition works, sort of badly but forcibly.
Did she mention pork pie hat?
No, we didn't really acknowledge each other. She passed me on the sidewalk and I looked at her kind of openly, but hidden within myself the way one does on the street, like giving her the option in case she remembered me or wanted to, but she didn't or whatever. Her eyes were red and dull, hanging over her black mask. It seemed like a bad idea to say hello, but at the last minute I smiled stupidly.
And that was enough to convince you that he was really gone?
All the copies of the poem had disappeared by then. I went wandering around like I was still dreaming, hoping I might find a trace of one, wondering what I might feel if in fact he was dead, if anything at all.
That’s not so crazy
I was listless and bitter that night and after getting lost in my phone for an unfathomably long stretch instead of going to bed I remembered that I had a photo of the poem; that I’d taken a picture of it at some point, to read later, in the privacy of my apartment.
Is there anything more pathetic than poetry when you’re alone?
I zoomed in as far as I could to make out the words and read it backwards, the way I would the newspaper when I was a kid, just to stave off the boredom of it all. It was when I scrolled down through the verse numbers, doom scrolled if you like from top to bottom that I saw it.
Saw what?
The elevator buttons going on and on, and on like every and any second now,,,
?
go ahead and jump!
