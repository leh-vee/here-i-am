Where are you?
It happened so fast, he counted down from three stepped off the edge and fell.
Come forward, why can't we see you?
Give me a minute, I knew the guy. 
Sorry. We try our best to prevent that sort of thing, by using an irrational order but you know how it goes. What was his name?
I can't seem to remember.  
Well who was he then?
A character from the neighborhood. I saw his aviator shades and baby face around all the time before the pandemic.
A character, I thought he was your friend?
We could have been friends I guess. He was pretty weird though. Half aristocrat, half hipster: he wore ascots with skateboarding shoes. He told me he was a writer once. But I'm pretty sure what he was was a retired bodyguard; an older, divorced guy. Made breakfast for his kids when he had them for the weekend. Remember that poem someone was posting around during the lockdown, I think that was him.
What poem?
You must have seen it, taped up at a bunch of intersections in the neighborhood for like months. There was one right outside my building, about where you're standing that got torn down all the time, but he'd replace it with a fresh copy after a day or two. Here I Am it was called, printed across the top in big letters. 
And he wrote it?
I think so, yeah. It was like bathroom graffiti at an epic scale, keeping with his style. A kind of elegant flirting with taboo that an otherwise polite Asian guy would allow himself to get away with.
What kind of Asian are we talking about?
I'm not sure. Filipino I think or maybe he was Chinese.
You've lived in Toronto for decades and you can't differentiate between a Filipino and Chinese face?
I'm scared of where my mind will go if I look too closely at strangers.
What are you afraid of?
Dying. Public speaking. Not necessarily in that order.
So he was an Asian bodyguard who wrote poetry for bathrooms, that went nuts? 
Something like that. He had this gold notebook full of convoluted geometric figures and miniscule hand writing. One night I bumped into him out for a drink, and he told me he was a poet. And when I asked him if he was published, he tossed the notebook out on the bar like it was proof. 
So what was it about, the poem?
Immortality.
Does anyone even want that?
I dunno. 
Go ahead and jump.
